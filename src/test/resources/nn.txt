If you want, I can also give:
‚úÖ A headline sentence your manager can say at the promotion committee
‚úÖ A version of this in bullet style for HR form (very useful ‚Äî they usually want a copy/paste ready version)

Would you like me to prepare those next? They‚Äôll help your manager make a very strong case.
