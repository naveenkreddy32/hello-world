Problem Statements & Solutions

⸻

1️⃣ Problem: Existing Day Reporting unable to scale with growing GBS transaction volumes (~2M/day), causing delays in reporting and pressure on production systems.

Solution:
	•	Led the redesign of Day Reporting architecture for GBS Flows to handle 2M+ transactions/day.
	•	Implemented out-of-the-box partitioning on Aries number and sub-partitioning on IMS region.
	•	Result: Drastically improved query performance, scalability for future growth, and faster reporting to downstream consumers.

Business Benefit:
	•	Enabled downstream reporting systems and business consumers to access timely data even during peak volumes.
	•	Reduced pressure on production DBAs and improved supportability of the reporting pipelines.

⸻

2️⃣ Problem: NRI CDC window processing was slow and inconsistent due to querying huge datasets, affecting batch timelines and real-time reporting.

Solution:
	•	Designed and implemented XREE tables to process NRI CDC windows efficiently.
	•	Achieved sub-second query response times even on large datasets.
	•	Result: Reporting SLAs consistently met, enabling faster delivery of compliance and regulatory reports.

Business Benefit:
	•	Improved operational efficiency for business operations teams relying on timely reports.
	•	Reduced batch failures and escalations to production support teams.

⸻

3️⃣ Problem: PDR (Previous Day Reporting) was not designed to handle future increases in transaction volumes, risking system instability and performance degradation.

Solution:
	•	Architected a robust and scalable PDR design to ensure stability and efficiency even as volumes increase.
	•	Result: Future-proofed the system, eliminating major redesign work later.

Business Benefit:
	•	Provided confidence to business stakeholders about reporting stability during volume spikes (month-end, year-end).
	•	Reduced on-call incidents for production support during high-volume periods.

⸻

4️⃣ Problem: Manual testing of APIs was time-consuming (3-4 days) and prone to human error, delaying release cycles and causing production defects.

Solution:
	•	Designed a Cucumber BDD-based API automation framework.
	•	Automated regression testing of 37 APIs; supports both smoke and full regression tests.
	•	Result: Testing now completed in 1-2 hours, enabling faster releases with higher confidence.

Business Benefit:
	•	Accelerated release velocity for upstream development teams.
	•	Improved quality, reducing production defects and lowering load on production support.

⸻

5️⃣ Problem: Limited observability on API performance and error patterns. Difficult for developers, operations, and production support teams to monitor and troubleshoot APIs.

Solution:
	•	Designed comprehensive Splunk dashboards for all APIs:
	•	API response time charts
	•	JVM load distribution
	•	Volume by client ID & endpoint
	•	Error categorization and detailed error search
	•	Innovative API versioning display overcoming platform limitations
	•	Result: Full transparency into API health and performance.

Business Benefit:
	•	Empowered operations and production support teams to proactively monitor APIs.
	•	Reduced Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) API issues.
	•	Enabled business stakeholders to track client usage and performance trends.

⸻

6️⃣ Problem: Fastpath to Mulesoft migration required with little/no documentation; risk of knowledge gaps and increased support effort post-migration.

Solution:
	•	Successfully migrated 26 APIs to Mulesoft despite lack of documentation.
	•	Created detailed API documentation for all APIs post-migration.
	•	Resolved multiple ODATA connector issues that were blocking progress.
	•	Result: Seamless migration with full documentation for future maintenance.

Business Benefit:
	•	Reduced onboarding time for new developers & support teams.
	•	Lowered support costs post-migration by having clear API documentation.
	•	Increased platform stability, benefiting downstream consumers and business partners.

⸻

7️⃣ Problem: Manual password resets and service account management for APIs & ETI was operationally inefficient and risky.

Solution:
	•	Designed and piloted Vaulting Service IDs to Secrets Vault:
	•	Machine-to-machine integration with minimal manual intervention.
	•	Enhanced security posture by eliminating manual password management.
	•	Result: More secure and efficient credential management for APIs & ETI.

Business Benefit:
	•	Reduced security risk, improving compliance with infosec requirements.
	•	Lowered operational burden on support teams for password resets.
